Have you every wandered through the grocery store and bought something just because it looks awesome. Food and beverage companies know that we do. Some companies such as Target have created a whole ethos in their store designing the customer experience. In fact, Target's packaging is why I became a graphic designer. 

My name is Helen Lavie and I am a graphic designer and Louisiana native based in Houston, Texas. I am obsessed with food packaging and spend my free time wandering down grocery aisles looking for innovative packaging and how a product's packaging can entice us to buy it (even if it's not on our grocery list.)
