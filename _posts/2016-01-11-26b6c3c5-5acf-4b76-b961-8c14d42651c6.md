Referencing Culture - Love On A Bottle

[Abita Brewery][0] started in 1986 as a microbrewery in Abita Springs, LA and is now [27th out of the 50][1] largest microbreweries in the US according to the Brewers Association a not-for-profit trade group representing small and independent craft brewers. Growing up in Louisiana, I have watched Abita steadily become a national brand and the love for this delicious and well crafted range of beer spread. (Can you tell I adore the brand? I love their beer and their design! So of course, I had to pick up one bottle of their new series.

The bottle design for Abita's Bourbon Street series is fun, full of character, and representative of the design present in the French Quarter. Historical street signs and gas lamps pair with hand drawn signage and decorative elements that refer back to original ironwork still gracing most doorways and balconies. Texture is built into the design with a wooden background enticing me to pick up the bottle. Then, the feel of the design provides interest and invokes my imagination of the wooden barrel I imagine the beer was aged in. The shading on "Imperial Stout" provides a depth that transitions between the street sign and highlighted beer's traits.

I am very glad to have picked this bottle up as it was as delicious as it was enjoyable to look at!
